title: "Rails 5.1 Notes and Caveats"
---
This is the first year we will be using Rails 5.1 in this class. Also we are using [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/). On this page, you will find very important details and caveats that will help you be successful.

#### Versions
* Ruby 2.4.1
* Rails 5.1.x

#### Development Environment
* **RECOMENDATION** Don't use Cloud9, Eclipse or Idea: The book suggests using the Cloud9 environment. I have not used it so I cannot vouch for it. I know that when you get to your project you will not be using it. You should use the command line.
* **RECOMENDATION** Use Atom or Sublime as your text editor: There are other ones, particularly on Windows. Whatever you use, it needs to be simple text editor that reads and writes simple "ascii" files. I recommend Atom.
* **RECOMMENDATION** Don't use **RVM** or **Rbenv**. These are very respectable utilities (I use rbenv every day) but for a beginner they will cause more confusion than anything.
* **RECOMMENDATION** Use Bootstrap version 4 even though it's alpha.
