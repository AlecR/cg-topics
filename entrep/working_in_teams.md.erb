title: Working in teams
---
These notes are based on experience with student run teams. I have seen them succeed and have seen them struggle. Remember, you are not trying to become best friends with your teammates.  You are trying to get something done!

#### Why are teams important?

* Nothing of any importance is ever a solo operation
* Whatever your path is in the future, you will be part of a team
* What is the effect of adding people to a project?

#### Human Nature

* People tend to focus on tech vs. people because tech is easier
* Individual differences
* Strengths and weaknesses
* Play to your strengths
* Different people have different styles
* Different people have different constraints
* Introverts and Extroverts
* Be businesslike, constructive, flexible, respect
* I use peer and self assessments to judge performance

#### Leadership
* Everyone is doing the best they can *given the circumstances*
* Listen to each other
* Making and meeting commitments
* Everyone will be a leader at some point of the process

#### Roles
* Who is the "Boss"?
* Who will monitor to make sure everyone gets a voice?
* Who is an organizer and tracker?
* Don't be a freeloader

#### Planning
* You have to plan
* Don't over plan and don't under plan
* If you don't have an objective you are guaranteed not to get to it
* Self-monitor. Are we making progress or going around in circles?

#### How time is wasted
* An hour at the front of the project costs as much as an hour at the end
* Lack of a goal
* Lack of making and sticking to a decision

#### Dealing with Conflict
* You're not supposed to be best friends
* You're supposed to work out a way to get the most from each member
* Storming, Forming, Norming and Performing

#### Kickoff Discussion Tips
* Open Discussion
  * How do we like the product idea so far?
  * How can we make it more exciting?
* Go around and each student:
  * Describe the house you grew up in
  * Where are you on this grid?
  * What is your level of investment/commitment to the course?

#### Actionable Tips
1. **KickOff:** At the start, get to know each other a little. What do you like to do? What do you excel at? Are you more of a leader or more of a follower? Are you more of an ideas person or more of a doer? What is your level of investment in the project? Is it super important to you and you will invest any time needed, or do you have other priorities that will take precedence?
1. **Communication:** Lack or miscommunication is almost always the underlying cause of conflict on a team. Expect some disagreements. Be flexible. Listen to each other. Also observe: are there team members who don't get a chance to speakj up? Who are spoken over? Is no one speaking?
1. **Alignment:** You must make sure that there is alignment around the team's goal. Don't gloss over it. Seek out misallignment, speak up if you're not comfortable. It won't go away. Alignment means that everyone in general has a common understanding of the mission. Even if your particular view of things wasn't fully adopted, are you on board with a certain direction? If people have reservations they need to be discussed and not swept under the rug.

#### Norms
* One of the big challenges is to find time to meet, so try to be flexible.
* As a team, choose a fixed time and place to meet every week. Be flexible.
* Your first meeting is very important.
* Each member honestly say what your personal goals are for this course:
	* This course is my most important, I really care and will do anything to be successful
	* Or, I have a heavy courseload, I will do what I can but I have to balance
	* Or, I am perfectly happy with a "B", don't expect intensity from me.
* If everyone knows each other's perspective this will set expectations
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Talk about how you will make decisions:
	* Democratic vote
	* Decide or chose a leader to have final say
	* Divide up the domain (front end/back end/ etc) and assign it to people.

#### Technical
* Create a github repository for all your code from the very start
* Partition the work as much as you can to allow each person a bit of independence

#### Conflict
* Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* There is a non-zero probability that you will not get along with someone in your team
* Be ready for this and take it in stride. "Whoops, there it is!"
* You are not married, you are not best friends, you are just working on this project, now
* Don't try to resolve the conflict in email, it never works!
