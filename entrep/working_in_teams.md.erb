title: Working in teams
---
### Introduction

These notes are based on experience with student run teams. I have seen them succeed and have seen them struggle. Remember, you are not trying to become best friends with your teammates.  You are trying to get something done!

#### Best Practices for playing nice with others

##### What is a team for?
* Nothing of any importance is ever a solo operation
* Whatever your path is in the future, you will be part of a team

##### Kickoff
* At the start, get to know each other a little
* What do you like to do?
* What do you excel at?
* Are you more of a leader or more of a follower?
* Are you more of an ideas person or more of a doer?
* What is your level of investment in the project?
* Is it super important to you and you will invest any time needed, or do you have other priorities that will take precedence?

##### Be a Pro
* Show up on time
* Be polite
* Be respectful
* Do your part
* Be flexible
* "Can I count on you?"

##### Alignment
* If you don't have an objective you are guaranteed not to get to it
* You must make sure that there is alignment around the team's goal. *
* Don't gloss over it.
* Seek out misallignment, speak up if you're not comfortable. It won't go away.
* Alignment means that everyone in general has a common understanding of the mission.
* Even if your particular view of things wasn't fully adopted, are you on board with a certain direction?
* If people have reservations they need to be discussed and not swept under the rug.

##### Over-communicate
* Listen to each other
* Don't keep things bottled up
* People tend to focus on tech vs. people because tech is easier
* Ask questions

##### When you are disappointed in someone
* Remember that *everyone is doing as well as they can, under the circumstances*
* Communicate clearly and empathetically what **you see** and **how it makes you feel**
* Your goal is to find a way to get the best out of each other and out of each member of the team
* Different people have different styles. Different people have different constraints. Introverts and Extroverts

##### Conflict
* There may be conflict. Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing
* There is a non-zero probability that you will not get along with someone in your team
* Be ready for this and take it in stride. "Whoops, there it is!"
* You are not married, you are not best friends, you are just working on this project, now
* Don't try to resolve the conflict in email, it never works!

##### Leadership
* Everyone will be "the boss" at some point of the process
* Being a "leader" means setting an example for others to emulate
* Who will monitor to make sure everyone gets a voice?
* When "delegating", focus more on the 'what' than the 'how'
* Others will never solve the problem just the way you would have
* Watch: You might learn something!


##### Meetings
* Use meeting time effectively
* Who "owns" the meeting?
* Someone should volunteer to take notes on the meeting
* Anyone should question whether we are wasting time
* Self-monitor. Are we making progress or going around in circles?
* Track who is taking responsibility for what

##### How time is wasted
* An hour at the front of the project costs as much as an hour at the end
* Lack of a goal
* Lack of making and sticking to a decision

#### Kickoff Meeting Agenda Suggestion
* Your first meeting is extra important.
* One of the big challenges is to find time to meet, so try to be flexible
* As a team, try to choose a fixed time and place to meet every week. Be flexible.
* Each member honestly say what your personal goals are for this course:
	* This course is my most important, I really care and will do anything to be successful
	* Or, I have a heavy courseload, I will do what I can but I have to balance
	* Or, I am perfectly happy with a "B", don't expect intensity from me.
* If everyone knows each other's perspective this will set expectations
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Talk about how you will make decisions:
	* Democratic vote
	* Decide or chose a leader to have final say
	* Divide up the domain (front end/back end/ etc) and assign it to people.
