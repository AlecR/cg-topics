title: Working in teams
---
#### Introduction

These notes are based on experience with student run teams. I have seen them succeed and have seen them struggle. Remember, you are not trying to become best friends with your teammates.  You are trying to get something done!

#### Best Practices for Teaming

<%= callout("Question", " Have you had opportunities to work in teams? At Brandeis? How did it go? To you have any tips? ") %>

##### What is a team for?
* Nothing of any importance is ever a solo operation
* Whatever your path is in the future, you will be part of a team
* Two kinds of teams
  * Long-lived teams (a department in a company)
  * Shorter-lived teams (pickup basketball game, medical staff in emergency room), sometimes referred to as "teaming"
* Aspects of teaming
  * "Software": how to think and to be and to act in an effective team
  * "Hardware": tools and techniques to maximize team's productivity and success (next class)

##### Be a Pro
<%= callout("Question", " What does it mean to you to `be a pro`? ") %>

* **Show up on time**
* **Do your part**
* **Be flexible**
* **Be reliable: "Can I count on you?"**
* **Be respectful**
* **Be nice**

##### Alignment
* **Alignment**: means that everyone in general has a common understanding of the mission.
* **Ensure**: Work towards achieving alignment. Invest time. Don't gloss over it.
* **Misallignment:** Speak up if you're not comfortable. It won't go away. Reservations they need to be discussed and not swept under the rug.
* **Get on Board**: Even if your particular view of things wasn't fully adopted, are you on board with a certain direction?

##### Over-communicate
* **90%:** Most teaming challenges are related to communications
* **Listen**: Listen to each other
* **Speak Up**: Don't keep things bottled up. It gets worse.
* **Beware of email and chat**: Don't try to resolve conflict in email, it never works!
* **Questions**: Ask them, and check that everyone is getting a chance to speak
* **People over Tech**: People tend to focus on tech vs. people because tech is easier

##### Leadership
<%= callout("Question:", " How can you show leadership when you are on a team?") %>

* **Who?**: Everyone can/should be a leader
* **What's a leader?**: It means setting an example for others to emulate
* **"Delegating"**: Focus more on the 'what' than the 'how'. Others will never solve the problem just the way you would have

##### Meetings
<%= callout("Question:"," Are meetings useful? When are they not useful?, have you had to run a meeting? What does it mean?") %>

* **Time**: Use meeting time effectively. Anyone should question whether we are wasting time
* **Owner**: Who "owns" the meeting?
* **Value**: Do I need to be here? Am I contributing something? Or am I learning soemthing?
* **Action items**: Track who is taking responsibility for what

##### When you are disappointed in someone
<%= callout("Question:", " What kinds of things cause conflict when working in a team?") %>

* **Everyone is doing their best**: Remember that *everyone is doing as well as they can, under the circumstances*
* **Communicate clearly**: and empathetically what **you see** and **how it makes you feel**
* **Getting the best**: Your goal is to find a way to get the best out of each other and out of each member of the team
* **Styles**: Different people have different styles. Different people have different constraints. Introverts and Extroverts

##### Conflict
* **Challenges**: There may be conflict. Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* **Stages**:  Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing
* **Expect it**: Be ready for this and take it in stride. "Whoops, there it is!"
* **Perspective**: You are not married, you are not best friends, you are just working on this project, now

#### Kickoff Meeting Agenda Suggestion
* Your first meeting is extra important.
* One of the big challenges is to find time to meet, so try to be flexible and choose a fixed time and place to meet every week. Be flexible.
* Each member honestly say what your personal goals are for this course:
	* This course is my most important, I really care and will do anything to be successful
	* Or, I have a heavy courseload, I will do what I can but I have to balance
	* Or, I am perfectly happy with a "B", don't expect intensity from me.
* If everyone knows each other's perspective this will set expectations
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Choose team lead
  * Likely it will be the team captain but not necessarily
  * "First among equals"
  * Responsible for driving decision making
* Talk about how you will make decisions:
  * Team leader only breaks ties
  * Democratic vote
  * Seperate domains and decentralized
