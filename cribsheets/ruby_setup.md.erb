title: Highly Specific Set Up Instructions
---
Ruby is a big magical world with tons of tools, libraries, successfull instructions, and dead-end tutorials. That's why I will give you highly specific instructions. Please follow them to the letter. Why? Because I've been down the road and I can avoid you pain and help you live longer.

#### MS Windows

If you have a windows computer, I strongly urge you to find out how to create a second Linux boot partition. 

Many students have traveled this road before you and while (using Turing-complete kind of logic) you can technically do everything with Windows, the road is absolutely full of potholes and pain.

Setting up a Linux partition is easy and very cheap. You need about 14Gig free. You will find the user interface fairly familiar. Overall things will go easier.

#### Mac and Linux

These are the preferred platforms. They both come with Ruby preinstalled and you can lead a happy life without changing anything. 

#### Customizations

* If you want to install a later version of Ruby:
  * **Do Not** install "RVM"
  * **Do* Install [Ruby Environment Manager rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
* You will need a simple text editor. Use whatever you are comfortable with
  * If you need a suggestion, check out [Subilime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
