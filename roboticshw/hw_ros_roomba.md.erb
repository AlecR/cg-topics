title: ROS roomba
desc: Simple ROS program to run around a rectangular space, while avoiding walls.
---
#### Intro
* The iRobot ROOMBA is a vaccum cleaner. It moves in straight lines in a room until it comes to a wall or obstacle. At this point it stops and rotates in place for some number of degrees. And then it takes off again until it hits another obstacle.
* You will be writing a ROS node to exhibit this behavior
* Decide on two teams of three people, however you like
* Initially write and test in simulation (using Gazebo)
* Then test in a live robot
* The challenge is first, just getting it to work

#### Project
* In two teams (self organized) of three
* Using two TB3s
* Write a new program which has a robot drive through an area surrounded by walls, and act something like a variation on a roomba. That is to say, it drives around until it comes within 30cm of an obstacle, rotates in place, and continues in a new direction. You can elaborate this any way you like. The challenge beyond just getting it to work, is to make sure it doesn't get stuck somewhere. See how robust you can make it.
