* **Proposer**: Pito Salas

* **Product name**: CarID

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Take a picture of a car and find out the market price and other information about it

* **Product Summary:** This mobile app looks simple but is actually quite sophisticated. It asks the user to take or supply a single photograph of a car, perhaps in a parking lot or in a driveway. With that single photo the app determines the make, model and year of the car, and looks up public information about the car. The core value is the (market) price of the car. But once we have associated a person with an interest in buying a car, all kinds of eCommerce opportunities become clear.

* **Elevator pitch:**

* **Describe the customer(s):**

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:**

* **Customer Pains/Gains:** \[describe what problems the product will eliminate for the customer\]
