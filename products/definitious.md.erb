* **Proposer**: Pito (based on a project from JBS years ago)

* **Product name**: Definitious

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Give a brief ("cocktail party") explanation of something in Wikipedia instead of a multi-page essay that covers everything

* **Product Summary:**
When I look up something like TCP/IP or United States or Apple or Binary Sort in Wikipedia I get a comprehensive answer, useful if I am studying the topic. However often, all I want is the short, tweet length response. TCP/IP: The network protocol on which the present day internet is built. United States: Country in North America, south of Canada and North of Mexico. Etc.

* **Elevator pitch:**
