*11 Questions*: Like [10Q](http://www.doyou10q.com) but focused on college students. Once each year, on Oct 1 (or any other arbitrary date), subscribers get asked 11 Questions relevant to their future plans and college careers. They have 11 Days to answer after which their answers go into a vault. They can't edit or look at them again. Until 12 months later. They see their answers to see how things really turned out. And they get the same 10 Questions again. It's playing with time and time travel and looking back and into the future.
