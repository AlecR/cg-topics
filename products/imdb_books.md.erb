title: IMDB For Books
desc: Bibliofiles are always looking for facts about books, from author, genre, reviewers, themes, topics, summaries. Does what IMDB does, but for books.

IMDB for Books: A service just like IMDB but for books: titles, genres, authors, publishers, lists of reviews, etc. This would be a very cut and dry “databasy” application that organizes information about books in a factual way. It would not contain reviews or any other subjective information, but if anything, point to it.
