UberRental brings together these car owners with people who need to use a car for an errand or more. The key is in the community and verification. The owners and renters come from a known community, a college campus or corporate office. THere is an inherent basis in trust, and, the car is by definitely near the renter, so there's no delivery or parking problem. Everybody wins!
