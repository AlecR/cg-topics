title: Scaling by Caching
---
### Scalability Pattern: General Caching
* Save the result of a request with a given set of parameters.
* In a future request with the same parameter (maybe) return the same result
* Memoization:
  * caching applied to an individual method
  * A basic programming technique
* System level caching. Storage:
  * In 'local' memory
  * In 'remote' memory
  * In database
  * In Cloud
* Name-value databases
  * Very fast searches and lookups
  * Distributed searches and distributed databases
  * Robust across system and application failures
