  * Is it a business or a hobby?
  * What is the objective?
  * Is it sustainable?
  * How much investment does it need?
  * How do YOU define success?
  * You must have a goal in terms of a metric
* Metrics: Money:
  * Where does the revenue come from?
  * When does it arrive?
  * What metrics drive it? (revenue drivers)
* Metrics: Non-money
  * It's not always about money
  * But you still have to have a quantitative goal
  * Number of people vaccinated
  * Number of students who get an internship
  * Number of voters who vote
* Some models for growth (of the metric)
  * Sticky Engine of Growth (subscription)
  * Viral (users invite other users)
  * Paid (e.g. advertising)

  * Election is happening at a known date
  * Objective: recruit volunteers to talk to 5% of population of the state
  * 5% of population: about 300,000 people
* Questions:
  * How are you going to recruit volunteers?
  * How much money will I need to fund this project?
  * How long will it take?
  * How can I tell as time passes how well I am doing?

<%= discussion_box "Brainstorm an approach. Figure out how you could determine whether you would have achieved your goal by election day, and whether you can find out along the way whether you were on track. I am not looking for a number, but a conceptual idea on how you might do it. 15 minutes." %>
