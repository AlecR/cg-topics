title: Measure the effect of a pivot

#### Measuring effect of a pivot
* Identify the key 'stages' that users experience on site
* Example:
	* User discovers and comes to the site (Acquisition)
	* Create account, logs into the site and gets first "dose" of value (Activation)
	* Comes back more times. Adds content (text, images, whatever) (Retention)
	* Invites friends (Referral)
	* Pays (or causes revenue) (Revenue)
* <%= discussion "Do these stages all work for our product?" %>

* These are not arbitrary!!
	* they figure directly into your eventual business model
	* depending on your goals and your stage they will be different
		* How many people responded to your email
		* answered your survey
		* answered a question
		* asked a question
		* etc.
* This becomes a classic "funnel" (sales, marketing etc.)
* <%= discussion "why do you think we call it a funnel?" %>

* Metrics... Metrics... Metrics
	* You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
	* Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
	* Do the pivot
	* Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved
