#### Sustainable growth
<%= discussion "Under what circumstances do we say that we have sustainable growth?" %>

* Excludes one-time campaigns and actions
* Systematic: built into the product's usage
* Comes from actions of past and existing users or customers
* There are many ways in which using a product can drive revenue
	1. Word Of Mouth (people recommend your product to others)
	1. Side Effect of Usage (people see you using and want to use it too. Or in order to benefit you have to invite.)
	1. In-product purchases (part of the experience of the product requires you to spend money inside it.)
	1. Subscription (or need to re-buy) (access charges, periodicals, expiration or consumption.)
  1. Funded advertising (When advertising gets more users, and is funded from revenue from users.)
