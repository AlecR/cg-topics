#### "Business Model Canvas"
*(based on [Business Model Generation](http://businessmodelgeneration.com/book) and follow on research, books and tools)*

* One way to sructure strategic planning, analysis
* Checklist helps cover all the bases when designing a business model
* Handy if have one of several possibilities that you are examining
* Typically the responses in each box are bulletted lists not essays
* Notice that each response is a testable hypothesis
* Note that a single business might operate based on two different models (but it's more complex to do that and usually not the right way to go.)

##### An interesting variant
* [Lean Canvas](https://app.leanstack.com/canvases/227932): Looks like a refinement of the Business Model Canvas, but very similar in concept. Worth a look.

#### Building Blocks

##### Value Proposition (the offer)
* Pains
  * What "job" are is customer "hiring" the product to do?
  * What problem/pain do we solve for the customer?
  * Look for *serious*, *major* pains, not "nice to haves"
* Pain Relief
  * What product/service do we deliver to the customer?
  * How do we do that compared to what they do today?
* Examples:
  * Brand new problem/solution
  * Better performance
  * Better price
  * Greater customization
  * More convenient
  * Higher status
  * Greater safety
* **What did you come up with:** PlanIt

##### Customer Segments (for whom)
* What customer or groups of customers?
* And who are the most important ones?
* What makes a distinct segment?
* If a set of customers require:
  * A different offer
  * different channels
  * different types of relationships
  * different payment models, etc
* Examples:
  * Mass market
  * Niche market
  * Segment of larger market
  * Two sided market, etc
* Note that you might be going after more than one!
* **What did you come up with:** ex-TravelIT

##### Revenue Streams (pricing models)
* Who pays whom?
* What do they pay for?
* What's the unit?
* Must feel "appropriate" and "fair
* Per customer segment/offer
* How do you set and adjust the price?
* Examples:
  * simple purchase
  * usage fee ("pay by the drink")
  * subscription
  * licensing
  * in-app-purchases
  * lease
* **What did you come up with:**: Habet

##### Channels (How do I reach customers?)
* How do you reach a customer? How do they want to be reached?
* Are you able to reach them in that way?
* You need to figure out how to:
  * generate awareness,
  * allow evaluation
  * enable purchase
  * deliver the product,
  * provide after sales follow up
* Examples:
  * Web site
  * Direct Sales,
  * Reseller web site (e.g. Amazon)
  * Stores
  * Wholesaler
  * social media
* Why? Major cost driver
* **What did you come up with:** VRx

##### Customer Relationships (ongoing)
* What kind of ongoing relationship does your customer want with you?
* Why does it matter? Key part of the value proposition; also a major cost driver.
* Examples:
  * Sending/responding to personal emails
  * self-service
  * support site
  * face-to-face contact
  * online community
  * co-creation
* **What did you come up with:** Game of Loans

##### Key Resources (What do you need for success)
* Go a level deeper than just "money".
* Identify all the things you will need
* Examples:
  * expertise (we need a bigdata person)
  * IP (we need to license music)
  * physical (we will need a shop floor to do assembly.)
* **What did you come up with:** AmIFull

##### Key Activities (To do list)
* This might seem obvious but it's worth calling out
* Examples:
  * software development,
  * packaging and shipping
  * manufacturing
  * support
  * marketing
  * manufacturing
  * licensing; etc.
* **What did you come up with:** Interleaguers

##### Key Partnerships
* What outside entities do you have to establish trust with for your model to work?
  * Suppliers
  * Resellers
  * Distributors?
  * A web distributor like Amazon
  * Maybe Apple, because they have to approve your app
  * Are you licensing something from a partner?
* **What did you come up with:** VRx

##### Cost Structure
* 'Simply' all the costs needed to run the businss model
  * Fixed costs,
  * per-unit variable costs
  * Per-employee variable costs
* Based on Key resources, key activities and key partnerships
* **What did you come up with:** AirChef

#### Conclusions - Business Model Canvas
* Assures that you consider and address all the pieces of your business model
* Is it a business or a hobby? Business includes much more than just the product
* Gives you a way to partition the work, and present the results
