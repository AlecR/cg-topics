#### Elevator Pitch Critique
Here's an example elevator pitch. Please critique it:

<blockquote>
"We're building an app which for travelers. It will give a few focused recommendations based on where they are, what they want to do and how much time they have have. We'll crowdsource recommendations, and have game mechanics to make it fun. Initially we will focus on growth, as we determine the best way to make money. We're thinking along the lines of coupons or sponsored recommendations. It will be designed as a platform so we can easily release it for other cities"</blockquote>

##### An answer to the question: "So, what's your business do?"
* Answer in a clear, interesting, catchy, provocative manner.
* Purpose:
  * Persuade listener, not to describe the whole product or service
  * Spoken or read to potential investor or board member
  * Get listener to say, "Tell me more!"
  * Its' not an ad!
* Keys:
  * Put yourself in the listeners shoes, really!
  * Hook them with the first words out of your mouth.
  * Imagine that they say, "So What?" in response to each point
  * If there's a very obvious objection, respond to it right away.
