* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. Let's call that the SDV - Showcase Day Version. <%= team_deliverable "Images of a detailed 'paper prototype' of the SDV of your product, applying the principles you learned about in the readings above. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work. Use actual paper or, better, balsamiq.com. PLEASE: However you do it, please make sure your images are legible. Phone photo of a pencil drawing is often not!" %>
