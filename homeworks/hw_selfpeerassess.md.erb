title: Self and Peer assessments
note: "75 + n * 5"
---
**Self and Peer Assessments:** Think about your and each of your teammates contribution to your team. Factors to think about: attendance and timeliness to the team meetings, contributions in words and deeds, contributor to positivity and harmony, willingness to step in when things go wrong, factor in the overall success of the team so far. For yourself, and each individual team member, rate them numerically:
* **4:** Critical factor in our success, a leader, always there for us, couldn't have succeeded without him/her. It's unlikely that all members rate a 4.
* **3:** A good contributor, a full fledged team member, glad to have him or her on the team.
* **2:** Usually a good collegague to have, but could have done more. Didn't always show up or deliver on commitments. Not sure we could count on him/her.
* **1:** Disappointing, often a no-show, caused us delay and frustration. A net negative.
* Write at most 3 sentences to explain ratings other than 3.
* <%= deliverable("Posted on latte as a pdf. It should be around 5-10 lines of text total.")%>
