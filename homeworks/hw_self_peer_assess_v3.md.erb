    AM (me): Was present for all meetings, feels like I was the leader - 5
    MA: Missed so many meetings, even when promised didnâ€™t show up. Nice person though - 3
    RO: My partner who was as reliable and had a lot of key ideas. Figured out the pricing model. - 5
    OR: Pretty good, tried hard to help and was reliable. Good worker. - 4
