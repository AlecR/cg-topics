title: Cosi 105 Final Deliverables!
---

#### No Final Exam but Final Deliverables

1. Individual final programming assignment: 
	* Elevator Simulation
	* Assignment is detailed here: <%= link_to_topic :pa_elevator %>
1. Team nanoTwitter deliverables
	* nanoTwitter Github Repo
	* nanoTwitter Scalability Tests
	* nanoTwitter Portfolio page

* Due on "day of the final"

#### How nanoTwitter will be assessed
* Quality of the engineering. 
	* How is the design, is it broken down into some classes?
	* Is there attention to single responsibility principle and other good design practices? 
	* Are the classes and methods reasonably brief. How does the code look?
	* Are there tests and are they being run automatically?
* Quality of the Scalability. 
	* How well does the nT perform under load from loader.io using the specific testing rules that we described.
	* What steps did you take to help it scale better?
	* And what is final result?
* Fit and Finish. 
	* Does the final product look professional and clean? Did you read the requirements (from me) broadly and go beyond the very minimum? Or did you just barely get it to work? Does it look good and show pride of work?

#### nanoTwitter
* Exactly how we will be testing nanoTwitters performance
* Authentication
* Sessions
* Loader.io configuration for realistic testing
* Using Redis to speed up access
* Experimenting with another database

#### Porfolio Page
* Google Sites (or other)
* Make it look pretty!
* 2 page web site
* An "e-brochure" for your project
* Containing info such as:
	* Summary statement of assignment (1-2 paragraphs)
	* Screenshots
	* Technology Description
	* Interesting Engineering
	* Result of scalability work, timings etc.
	* Team members
	* Dates
