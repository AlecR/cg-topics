* Every lecture has a lecture number
* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable"
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get credit for it.
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
* All homework is handed in in Latte.
* All written papers, posts, reports, etc. must be in PDF format, with your name and project (if any) along the top.
* It is due before class on that day. Talk to us if that poses a problem.

#### Numbering scheme

<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>
* Some homeworks have explicit deliverables:
	* Will be clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
	* Are numbered, X.Y - X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture
	* Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
* To help you navigate, there are the following symbols:
  * <%= pdfbadge %>: this symbol reminds you that you are to submit a pdf to latte. Anything else will receive a 40.
  * <%= partbadge %>: this symbol tells you that this assignment is graded as "participation only". You will receive a 100 if you show a good faith effort, without regard to whether your answer is correct. You will receive a zero otherwise
  * <%= timebadge %>: This symbol reminds you that this assignment is due in the morning (8am to 10am depending on when class is) on the day of class. No late submissions or make ups are accepted.
  * <%= codebadge %>: \[**Not applicable to Cosi165**\] This symbol reminds you that this is a coding assignment which you will do inside your **portfolio**
