title: Installing Rails using VMWare
---
* This is not a foolproof recipe, it's just a guide of the kinds of things you have to do.

* These instructions are for people who want to run Rails and are currently on a Windows computer.

* Prerequisites: You must have around 25Gig free, preferably on a solid state disk (SSD)

#### Process
1. Install the appropriate version of VMWare. [Brandeis Software Store](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=253068f1-0c11-df11-85a5-0030487d8897&vsro=8)
1. Install [Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) into a newly created VMWare virtual machine
1. Run Ubuntu
1. Install Rails with rbenv: [How to install Rails, Ruby with Rbenv on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-16-04)

When everything is installed correctly, you should be able to check the versions with the following commands:

<%= code_begin %>
which ruby
which gem
which rails
<%= code_end %>

#### Notes
When you install ruby, check to see that your gem's env home looks a little like this:

<%= code_begin %>
$ gem env home
# => ~/.rbenv/versions/<ruby-version>/lib/ruby/gems/...
<%= code_end %>

When you do gem install rails, there may be some other errors. Get help from one of the TAs.
