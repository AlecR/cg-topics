title: General Grading Info
---
The final grade in this course will reflect my assessment of your performance in the course. This includes your participation; your mastery of the key learning objectives; your demonstration this both in written form and in code if appropriate; your application of what you've learned to working on a team; building an interesting product; and communicating what you achieved at the end of the semester.

Individual assignments are scored and weighted (see below), and used to determine class rank which in turn is used to determnine your grade.  Note that you will not get a numeric "final score", just a final grade. I will follow the guidelines from the University Bulletin:

* A -> High Distinction
* B -> Distinction
* C -> Satistfactory
* D -> Passing, but Unsatisfactory

#### Scores for assignments
Throughout the semester, there will be homeworks, assigments, presentations, quizes etc., small and large. Many of them are given a score in Latte. When something is scored, we will use a 1-100 scale, which you can interpret as follows.

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*      40: Not handed in

<%= callout("NOTE:", " You have a maximum 3 weeks after a score has been posted to call our attention to a possible error, oversight or misunderstanding. That is your responsibility.") %>

#### Deadlines and consequences
* Regular homework is due on the day of class, before time of class. You can get an extension by talking to the TA, up to a point. If you hand it in after a granted extension you will loose 15 points on it. If you don't hand it in at all you will get a zero for it.
* Participation-only work is graded at 100 if you make a good faith effort and zero otherwise. It is not graded for correctness. If you do not hand it in by the deadline, then it's graded as a zero. No extensions or do-overs are available for this kinds of work unless you've arranged ahead of time to be excused from class.
