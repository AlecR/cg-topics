title: General Grading Info
---

The final grade in this course will reflect my assessment of your participation, your mastery of the key learning objectives, your demonstration (in coding) that you are able to apply all that we learned to working on a team, building an interesting product, and communicating what you achieved at the end of the semester. Note that you will not get a numeric "final score", just a final grade. I will follow the guidelines from the University Bulletin:

* A -> High Distinction
* B -> Distinction
* C -> Satistfactory
* D -> Passing, but Unsatisfactory

#### Scores for assignments
There are many expecations, homeworks, assigments, quizes etc., small and large.any of them are given a score in Latte. When something is scored, we will use a 1-100 scale, which you can interpret as follows.

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*      40: Not handed in

<%= callout("NOTE:", " You have 3 weeks after a score has been posted to call our attention to a possible error, oversight or misunderstanding. That is your responsibility.") %>

#### Deadlines and consequences
* Regular homework is due on the day of class, before time of class
* You can get an extension by talking to the TA, up to a point
* If you hand it in after a granted extension you will loose 15 points on it
* If you don't hand regular homework in at all then you get 40 points for it, which will significantly affect the average!
* Participation-only work is graded at 100 if you make a good faith effort. It is not graded for correctness. If you do not hand it in by the deadline, then it's graded as a zero.
