title: General Grading Info
---

The final grade in this course will reflect my assessment of your performance in the course. This includes your participation; your mastery of the key learning objectives; your demonstration this both in written form and in code if appropriate;  you are able to apply all that we learned to working on a team; building an interesting product, and communicating what you achieved at the end of the semester. Note that you will not get a numeric "final score", just a final grade. I will follow the guidelines from the University Bulletin:

* A -> High Distinction
* B -> Distinction
* C -> Satistfactory
* D -> Passing, but Unsatisfactory

#### Scores for assignments
Throughout the semester, there will be homeworks, assigments, presentations, quizes etc., small and large. Many of them are given a score in Latte. When something is scored, we will use a 1-100 scale, which you can interpret as follows.

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*      40: Not handed in

<%= callout("NOTE:", " You have a maximum 3 weeks after a score has been posted to call our attention to a possible error, oversight or misunderstanding. That is your responsibility.") %>

#### Deadlines and consequences
* Regular homework is due on the day of class, before time of class
* You can get an extension by talking to the TA, up to a point
* If you hand it in after a granted extension you will loose 15 points on it
* If you don't hand regular homework in at all then you get 40 points for it, which will significantly affect the average!
* Participation-only work is graded at 100 if you make a good faith effort. It is not graded for correctness. If you do not hand it in by the deadline, then it's graded as a zero.
