title: Setting up a Linux Parition

#### How to do it
There are numerous web sites with instructions on how to do this. They are all similar and different. You have to find one that makes sense to you.

In general you have to:

1. If for some reason you have a bare machine, then install Windows first.
1. Make sure you have enough free diskspace before you begin. I think around 20gig should be plenty
1. Make sure you have a backup of your critical files
1. Now and only now, install Linux.


##### Here are some links
Note that I have not tested these and I cannot promise which one is the best one.
