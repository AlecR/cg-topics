title: ROS Services
---
#### Intro

* Alternative to using topics to communicate between nodes
* Unlike publish/subscribe uses a "remote procedure call" (RPC) model
* Service has a string name, a message for request, and a message for response
* Client calls service using the name and is blocked until reply comes
* Means that it is expected to be fast
* For performance, client can make a persistent connection to service

#### Details

* Service has a "type" which is the packgage name + the name of the srv file, e.g. `my_srvs/srv/PolledImage.srv` has the service type `my_srvs/PolledImage`
* A standard ROS message file is used to declare the messages
