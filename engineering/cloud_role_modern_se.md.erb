title: Role of the Cloud in Modern Software Engineering
---
#### Devops
* Old models:
  * development
  * quality assurance (test())
  * operations
  * New release every 6-12 months
* Stage 1: blurring line between dev and qa
  * test driven development
  * test automation
  * developers responsibility
  * New release every 1-6 months
* Stage 2: blurring line between dev qa and ops
  * Devops: New discipline that straddles or merges development and operations
  * Continuous integration and deployment
  * Feature switches
  * Cloud
  * What's a release?
* Keys:
  * coordination between development and operations
  * focus on business value
  * pervasive automation
  * blurred lines
* Key responsibility is to keep service running
  * Reliability (uptime)
  * Scalability (number of users or transactions)
  * Flexibility (rapid iteration)
  * Cost (Cloud services)
* How come now?
  * Scale in terms of servers and services
  * Geographic decentralization of servers
  * Automation is absolutely required
  * Automation is done with code (programming)
  * Software Engineering that is crucial although user never sees it
* Devops
  * Follows software engineering practices
  * Source code control
  * Testing
  * Code Reviews
  * Building and using tools
  * Automation

#### Modern Software Engineering Flow
  * Developers: work on local computers
  * Source Code Management: often on a remote service (Github)
  * Rapid deployment: multiple deployments per day
  * Continuous integration: As soon as code is checked in it is merged
  * Automated Testing: Unit, Integration and all kinds of tests
  * Deployment: Staging
