title: PA Rails 1
---
#### Intro

This assignment introduces the MVC architecture of Rails as you design a Web app in which users can select university classes. The data you need is available at cs.brandeis.edu/~prakhar/dataset.json.

The purpose of this assignment is for each student to independently practice their knowledge of the material separate from the team work. What you learn and practice here will definitely contribute to your work on the team project.

In the first part (of 3) you will build the basic rails application and import the data from the data file that we provide.

#### Part 1: Bootstrap UI, User accounts, Display data
1. Create a new rails application called Course Catalog
1. Setup a GitHub repo and automatic deployment to Heroku
1. Setup your application to use Bootstrap for the UI
1. Create a User model with user accounts where the first page of the app will ask users to sign in or sign up.
1. The university data is formatted in JSON. The first object provides a README from the university specifying the data schema.
1. Create models for instructor, subject, and course. 1. Load the data into your database tables - how? You donâ€™t need to store every field/attribute, just the ones you would like to include in your app.
1. UI: Once a user has signed up or logged in, your app will have four pages that a user can navigate to: Home, Subjects, Courses, Instructors.
  * Home - Display user info (Profile Page)
  * Subjects - Displays all the subjects from the database
  * Courses - Displays all the courses from the database
  * Instructors - Displays all the instructors from the database
