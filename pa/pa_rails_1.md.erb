title: PA Rails 1
---
#### Intro

This assignment introduces the MVC architecture of Rails as you design a Web app in which users can select university classes. The data you need is available at [This Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/folderview?id=0B0RwSGontLyAcG82akRlTjZZUGc&usp=sharing). The folder has 3 JSON files, each is a JSON array.

The purpose of this assignment is for each student to independently practice their knowledge of the material separate from the team work. What you learn and practice here will definitely contribute to your work on the team project.

In the first part (of 3) you will build the basic rails application and import the data from the data file that we provide.

#### Part 1: Bootstrap UI, User accounts, Display data
1. Create a new rails application called Course Catalog
1. Setup a GitHub repo and automatic deployment to Heroku
1. Setup your application to use Bootstrap for the UI
1. Create a User model with user accounts where the first page of the app will ask users to sign in or sign up. This requires implementing user authentication using any methods that is easier for you.
1. The university data is formatted in JSON. You may find detailed description from the university specifying the [data schema](http://registrar-prod-rhel6.unet.brandeis.edu/export/readme.html).
1. Create appropraiate models in order to represent the data for instructor, subject, and course, as given in three separate JSON files.
1. Load the data into your database tables. You donâ€™t need to store every field/attribute, just the ones you would need and like to include in your app.
1. UI: Once a user has signed up or logged in, your app will have four pages that a user can navigate to: Home, Subjects, Courses, Instructors.
  * Home - Display user info (Profile Page)
  * Subjects - Displays all the subjects from the database
  * Courses - Displays all the courses from the database
  * Instructors - Displays all the instructors from the database
