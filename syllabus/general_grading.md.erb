title: General Grading Info
---
The final grade in this course will reflect my assessment of your performance in the course. This includes your participation; your mastery of the key learning objectives; your demonstration this both in written form and in code (if applicable); your application of what you've learned to working on a team; building an interesting product; and communicating what you achieved at the end of the semester.

Individual assignments are scored and weighted (see below), and used to determine class rank which in turn is used to determnine your grade.  Note that you will not get a numeric "final score", just a final grade. I will follow the guidelines from the University Bulletin:

* A -> High Distinction
* B -> Distinction
* C -> Satistfactory
* D -> Passing, but Unsatisfactory

##### Marks for assignments

Throughout the semester, there will be homeworks, assigments, presentations, quizes etc., small and large. Many of them are given a mark in Latte. When something is marked, we will use a 1-100 scale, which you can interpret as follows.

* 90 - 100: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 80 - 90: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 70 - 80: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 60 - 70: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)
*  0 - 40: Not handed in

<%= callout("NOTE:", " You have a maximum 3 weeks after a mark has been posted to call our attention to a possible error, oversight or misunderstanding. That is your responsibility. After that, the mark as recorded in Latte will not be changed.") %>

<%= callout("NOTE:", " All written assignments should be in pdf format, with your name and assignment number at the top. This is to maintain the sanity of your instructors as we sort through the submissions. 20 points are deducted for non-pdf submissions, and another 20 for submissions without your name at the top.") %>
