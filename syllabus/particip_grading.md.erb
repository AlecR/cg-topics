#### Participation Only Assignments
<%= partbadge %> Assignments marked like this are "Participation Only" assignments. They allow you to show that you are participating in class, by reading and thinking about the work. They are not marked for correctness but for participation.

This indicates that you need to only show a sincere effort to respond to the question or prompt to receive a mark of 100. Otherwise you receive a mark of 0. (Non-pdf submissions lose 20 points, and not putting your name and assignment number will lose another 20 points.)

Participation-only work is graded at 100 if you make a *good faith* effort and zero otherwise. It is not graded for correctness. If you do not hand it in by the deadline (see Latte), then it's graded as a zero. No extensions or do-overs are available for this kind of work.
