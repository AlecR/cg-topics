##### Tech Presentation Guidelines

* The topic will be decided upon between the teacher and the student(s)
* Sometimes these are individual and sometimes group presentations; If it's a group presentation then each member of the group needs to take a proportion on the time.
* You will have 30 minutes, including questions, so plan accordingly

##### What a great Tech Pres looks like

* **New Tech or Concept**: We really learn about a new technical or computer science concept, technique, package or library. While some of it may have been heard about before, we feel that we have gained fresh insights.
* **Specific Package or Paper:** The presentation is focused, and goes beyond high level concepts, and introduce at least one technology or package, or go in depth about at least one scholarly paper that is relevant
* **Applicable:** At the end the we feel ready to incorporate what we learned into their assignments or project. It was specific enough to be actionable.
* **Real:** The presentation includes real code examples that run and illlustrate the specifics. Code examples, or live coding are part of the presentation, as well as links to relevant resources: libraries, papers, blog posts, etc.
