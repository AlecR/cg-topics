title: Technology Presentation

##### Tech Presentation Guidelines

* Plan for 45 minutes, 30 minutes presentation and 15 minutes for questions (although the questions need not all be at the end.)
* Make this a very technical presentation. You can have a short bit of background or history, say 5 minutes, if you want.
* The topic will be decided upon between the teacher and the student(s)
* Sometimes these are individual and sometimes group presentations. If it's a group presentation then each member of the group needs to take a proportion on the time.

##### Goals are:

* Audience really learns about a new technical or computer science concept, technique, package or library.
* Introduce at least one technology or package and incorporate at least one scholarly paper that is relevant
* At the end the audience is ready to incorporate what they learned into their assignments or projects
* Prepare examples (including code) that run and illlustrate the specifics
