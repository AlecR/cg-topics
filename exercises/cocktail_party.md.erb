#### (cocktail-free) cocktail party

<%= callout("What's the point?", " Just a quick, noisy, way to find out something about your classmates, interesting peope and maybe future teammates!") %>

#### Here we go!

* Go outside, line up into two rows of 20, sitting on the floor, facing another student
* You will have been provided an email with a series of numbered questions
* There will be a timekeeper calling out question number
* Introduce yourself to the person opposite to you and talk for 2 minutes about your answers to the numbered question
* When the time keeper calls time, one row of people shift left, and the person on the end runs to the other end.

#### Typical Questions
* "What do you remember most clearly about the house lived in when you were 1 year old"
* "Which of your ancestors would you most like to meet"
* Stuff like that!
