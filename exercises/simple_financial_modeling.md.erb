#### Practice using just Common Sense

* Break into into small groups
* Consider the following company

  * Company "MerchMachine"
  * Manufactures and sells t-shirts
  * With advertising expects to sell more t-shirts each month
  * Each t-shirt costs $7 to manufacture

* Notes:
  * There are variables missing and assumptions made
  * Ask yourself how much advertising might cost and how the advertising will impact the business
  * Ask yourself how many people it will take to run this business, perhaps at different stages
  * Ask yourself how much you can sell a t-shirt for
  * Apply your common sense

* Question
  * Under what circumstances is this going to be a good business, if ever?
