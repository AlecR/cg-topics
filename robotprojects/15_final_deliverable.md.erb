title: Final Deliverable
---
At the end of the semester, each team (inside, outside, human) will is asked to jointly submit a final deliverable. It includes: a report and source code from the semester.

#### Requirements for the Report
* Document the objectives, learnings, successes and failures, and final result of the work by the team
* Questions to reflect on:
  * What would we do different on our team if we were to do it over again?
  * How would we as a team recommend the course to be improved for next semester?
  * Is ROS the right framework for us to use? Are there other options? Should we write our own?

#### Requirements for the Code
* A set of source code which will be ready to be used by the nextgen students
* Code should include instructions on how to run it, if appropriate.
* Even if the code didn't make the final objectives, if it's instructive it can be appropriate to include.

#### Packaging
* Overall deliverable will be a git repo for the code
* The report can be either a [wiki attached to the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) or a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

#### General guidelines
* The whole package should showcase the work, you should be proud to let an employer look at it for example.
* Code should be documented, show good clean design
* The document should be "professional", meaning written in good english, with neat styling and formatting, include images, diagrams, links to resources, as needed
* The document should be between 5 and 20 pages
