title: Paper Prototyping
---
#### Paper Prototyping

##### Advantages
* Very cheap which saves money
* But also makes it less painful when it has to be changed totally
* Allows a user to take over and cross things out and suggest other ideas

##### You can take this as far as you want.
* Smaller snippets for the various ui widgets (e.g. drop down menus)
* Make a "screen flow diagram" by connecting the different sheets of paper with lines showing the transitions
* It is similar to a movie 'storyboard'

##### Here is my example: not good UI.
<%= include_image "/content/topics/images/paper_prototype.jpg" %>

##### Comments
* Why I insist on 'paper prototyping'
* How ugly can it be?
* Fast iteration
* Role of the UX Flow Chart
