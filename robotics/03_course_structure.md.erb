#### Course Structure
This course is still in an experimental phase and so you should expect that the content of the course will evolve as the semester progresses. With only one meeting a week, a lot if not most of the work will happen outside that meeting, with students working independently and in teams. There is a very high expectation and reliance on students' independence, initiative, self-motivation, and problem solving skills.

##### Week 1-3 - Rampup
During the first 4 weeks you will what you need to know about ROS. ROS is a rich distributed operating system which is used both in research and commerce. We will learn it through reading, discussions and programming exercises. 

##### Week 4-13 - Projects
We form teams of 3-5 students, depending on the size of the class. Each team works on a major step in the road to the full campus rover. This will require a lot of reading and studying of new concepts, as well as coding and testng and experimenting. The projects that we are likely to tackle are continuations of the work done last semester. It is likely that these will be the projects:
1. Improve and solve indoor navigation on a single floor. Using SLAM and feducials
1. Get our 'mutant' robot to  be reliable and then build the first generation of a real Campus Rover. It will require larger wheels and more powerful motors as well as a way to carry a payload. It will likely include a 3D camera and other sensors.
