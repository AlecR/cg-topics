title: Course Structure

#### Course Structure (updated as we progress through the first semester)
This course is a structured independent study. There will be relatively little lecturing, much discussion, personal research, and team exploration. There is a strong expectation that students work together to solve their own problems and share their learnings with the rest of the class.

#### Rough initial outline of the schedule

##### Week 1-4
Introduction to robotics with mini lectures covering some of the basics. Students will form teams of 3 students each to work together to learn the basics of robotics. Students will experiment individually and with their team to write programs for the mBot robot and think through how to deal with sensors and motors and process the noisy information that comes at their programs. This will culminate in a competition among the teams to write software to have their mBot's traverse mazes of growning challenge. The goal for this section at a high level is to develop a visceral understanding of the noise, inaccuracies, environmental effects and non-reproducability of naive approaches to programming a robot.

##### Week 5-6
Mini lectures on ROS the Robot Operating System combined with two online courses in autonomous vehicles, localizatation and mapping. The goal here is for students to really understand how to program in ROS and understand the subtleties of localization and obstacle detection without yet resorting to advanced algorithms like SLAM.

##### Week 7-10
We break into three teams, Inside Navigation, Outside Navigation and Human Interaction. Each team will pursue high level objectives in each of the areas. They will begin by readiung some of the seminal papers in their area and share their learnings with the class. They will organize themselves to decide what steps towards their objectives they will take and how they will organize their work.

##### Week 11-13
Final projects.
