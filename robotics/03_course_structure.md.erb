#### Course Structure
This course is still in an experimental phase and so you should expect that the content of the course will evolve as the semester progresses. With only one meeting a week, a lot if not most of the work will happen outside that meeting, with students working independently and in teams. There is a very high expectation and reliance on students' independence, initiative, self-motivation, and problem solving skills.

##### Week 1-4
Introduction to robotics with mini lectures covering some of the basics. Students will form teams of 3 students to learn how to program and control a simple Robot. Programming a "simple robot" is not simple, because once your software is interacting with the 'real world', odd things happen (see * Martin - Real Robots Dont Drive Straight).

Students will experiment individually and with their team to write programs for the mBot robot and think through how to deal with sensors and motors and process the noisy information that comes at their programs. This will culminate in a competition among the teams to write software to have their mBot's traverse mazes of growning challenge. The goal for this section at a high level is to develop a visceral understanding of the noise, inaccuracies, environmental effects and non-reproducability of naive approaches to programming a robot.

##### Week 4-6
Mini lectures on ROS the Robot Operating System combined with two online courses in autonomous vehicles, localizatation and mapping. The goal here is for students to really understand how to program in ROS and understand the subtleties of localization and obstacle detection without yet resorting to advanced algorithms like SLAM.

##### Week 7-13
We break into three teams, Inside Navigation, Outside Navigation and Human Interaction. Each team will pursue high level objectives in each of the areas. They will begin by readiung some of the seminal papers in their area and share their learnings with the class. They will organize themselves to decide what steps towards their objectives they will take and how they will organize their work.
