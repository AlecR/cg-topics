#### Course Structure
This experimental course is a structured independent study. We provide only a rough guide of how the semester will unfold. You will be expected to figure things out on your own in large part. It is very likely that we will not follow this very closely.

#### Rough initial outline of the schedule

##### Week 1-4
Introduction to robotics with mini lectures covering some of the basics. This will culminate in several maze following programs. We will start withg the simple Arduino mBot robot, one per student. The goal for this section at a high level is to develop a visceral understanding of the noise, inaccuracies, environmental effects and non-reproducability of naive approaches to programming a robot.

##### Week 5-6
Mini lectures on ROS the Robot Operating System combined with two online courses in autonomous vehicles, localizatation and mapping. The goal here is for students to really understand how to program in ROS and understand the subtleties of localization and obstacle detection without yet resorting to advanced algorithms like SLAM.

##### Week 7-10
We break into three teams, Inside Navigation, Outside Navigation and Human Interaction. Each team will pursue high level objectives in each of the areas. They will begin by readiung some of the seminal papers in their area and share their learnings with the class. They will organize themselves to decide what steps towards their objectives they will take and how they will organize their work.

##### Week 11-13
Final projects.
