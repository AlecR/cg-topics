#### Grading

Grading will be based on the following:

* ~33%: Participation: Engagement with the course, presence in classroom discussions, following up on commitments and obligations, contributing in the further design of the course with ideas and content. This will be assessed by the instructor's personal observations.

* ~33%: Individual work contributing to programming projects and team projects, documentation of this work in the lab notebooks, demontstrating seriousness and independence. This will be assessed by reviewing the lab notebooks, personal observation and peer and self assessments.

* ~33%: Final Deliverables: There will be a well defined, team based, final deliverable in the form of code and documentation. This will be assessed via a rubric.

#### Team Work
Much of the work will be in teams. Some of the steps will have teams of 2 or so students, but the bigger ones will have teams of 5 or maybe even all students together. Teams will usually be working in the Robotics lab, by themselves or with a teaching assistant. Teams will set their own weekly goals.
