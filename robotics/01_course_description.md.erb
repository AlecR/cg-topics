##### Course Description
Robots are everywhere, working quietly behind the scenes in labs and factories, on highways and in the home and now constantly on the front page. It is a rich area of Computer Science Research and at the same time a challenging arena of Applied Computer Science and Engineering. This makes for a very attractive context for learning.

This new experimental course will use a lecture/teamwork/lab format, currently with a single weekly meeting combined with extensive out-of-classroom team and lab work. We will learn many fundamentals of building a self-driving robots, and we will actually implement a basic robot. The program is organized around a series of assignments, first individual and then team-based. The focus throughout is for students to develop an understanding of the key theoretical concepts and algorithms, and at the same time learn by doing how the perfect universe of the simuilator differs sharply from the dirty, inaccurate, non-repeatable real world.
