##### Course Description
Robots are everywhere, working quietly behind the scenes in labs and factories, on highways and in the home and now constantly on the front page. It is a rich area of Computer Science Research and at the same time a challenging arena of Applied Computer Science and Engineering. This makes for a very attractive context for learning.

This class provides students the opportunity to collectively work together towards a practical long term goal, to be able to deliver packages around campus with the help of an autonomous robot. Overall, the course is centered around researching and coding under the ROS framework. Instead of having conventional lectures, class time will be used to bounce ideas off of one another and to decide on a plan of action. As long as the overall goal is kept in mind, students will be able to try out and experience using numerous different software and hardware solutions.

Learn about the behavior of robotics in real time situations, following the long term development of the Brandeis Campus Rover. Applications of implementation of theory to a real environment. Coding primarity in ArduinoC and Python. Concepts of Arduino, ROS, probability, localization, navigation, and more are surveyed on, with a deeper focus in the second half of the semester on relevant topics of choice. Learn to work in a team and demonstrate results in an engineer-like setting. Learn how to approach problems in a meaningful way and tackle emerging technologies. Usually offered every semester.

This new experimental course will use a lecture/teamwork/lab format, currently with a single weekly meeting combined with **extensive** out-of-classroom team and lab work. Students taking this course will be challenged to do a lot of independent research and problem solving in quite a technical area. While there are lectures, the bulk of the work is working with a few teammates. You will need to be resourceful and persistent.
