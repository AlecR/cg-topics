##### Experiential Course

Robots are everywhere, working quietly behind the scenes in labs and factories, on highways and in the home and now constantly on the front page. It is a rich area of Computer Science Research and at the same time a challenging arena of Applied Computer Science and Engineering. This makes for a very attractive context for learning.

In this experiential course, students will gain an understanding of how mobile robots are designed and work, while contributing towards the long term development of the **Campus Rover**. They will read the seminal papers from the field, and program algorithms on their own robots. Concepts of Arduino, ROS, probability, localization, navigation, SLAM and many more are surveyed and applied to a variety of projects.

This class requires students to work in teams, designing, implemnting and testing components of the robot. While there are weekly class meetings, the bulk of the learning will come from **extensive** out-of-classroom team and lab work. There will be much individual research to solve problems and get over obstacles because of the newness of this field. Students will sharpen their self-sufficiency and persistence in the face of setbacks. Whether they choose to go deeper into robotics or not, the experiences of learning from failure, and learning how to confront major unknowns will be important and meaningful.
