* Each part of ROS is run in it's own terminal window as a CLI (command line interface) utility
* Your ROS programs will be written in Python.
* You must have `roscore` running before you try to run any ros-related program
* All your work happens inside the directory `catkin_ws` (catkin is the builder, and ws stands for workspace. Don't change those names.)
* Remember the **TAB** key which is greatly automated for ROS developers
* In order to execute a program/script on Linux, you must `chmod +x filename.py`
* Also include the 'shebang': #!/usr/bin/env python

#### Key command line utilities (CLI) for using ROS
* `roscore`: Start the ROS Core program
* `rostopic`: Work with topics
  * `rostopic list`: list all ros topics that roscore knows about
  * `rostopic echo`: print out any topics that are published
  * `rostopic info`: ask ros what it knows about a certain topic

#### Other ROS CLI utilities
* `rqt_graph` - display topics and subscriptions in a nice graphical format
* `roslaunch` - tool to launch collections of ROS nodes in one command. Requires a 'package launch file'
* `rosversion -d` - what ros version is installed?

#### Linux Commands
* `apt` family of commands, see: https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/

#### Troubleshooting
If you get an error message that Ubuntu is running Lo-res mode or ubuntu just stalls during bootup, then:
* Ctrl-Alt F1  # get to terminal
* sudo apt-get update # update the apt-get app itself
* sudo apt-get upgrade # upgrade packages
* sudo apt-get install -f # apt-get fix its database
* restart
