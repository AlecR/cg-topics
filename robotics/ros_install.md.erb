title: ROS Install
---
#### Introduction
The generic ROS for TurtleBot3 instructions work very well to install onto Ubuntu 16.04 (if you happen to have that). See [Robotis TurtleBot3](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/introduction.html).

The architecture of ROS is that the computer onboard the robot as well as a separate wifi connected computer, e.g. a laptop, which they refer to as \[Remote PC\], both are running ROS. However you can get a lot done with just the \[Remote PC\], to test and experiment with ROS.

So if you don't natively run on Ubuntu 16.04 you are going to want to install it on your computer. **Do not try to install it directly on your mac or windows computer.** If you're curious, you can see  <%= link_to_topic :problems_ros_mac %>

So instead you are going to have to create a virtual environment of some kind. Here are two approaches, both have been tested and seem to work well. Use the one that appeals to you.

#### 1 - Use VMWare

Brandeis offers us VMWare for free. VMWare is a Virtual Machine software that allows you to run any operating system natively. I had good success with it. I created a VM with Ubuntu 16.04 and then followed the standard process.

##### Tips
* Place the VM file (which will be around 20Gig so you have to have that much space) on a SSD (solid state disk) and allocate additional memory for it. I found performance to be acceptable.

#### 2 - Create a Linux Partition
