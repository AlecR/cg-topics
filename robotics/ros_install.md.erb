title: ROS Install
---
#### Introduction
The generic ROS for TurtleBot3 instructions work very well to install onto Ubuntu 16.04 (if you happen to have that). See [Robotis TurtleBot3](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/introduction.html).

The architecture of ROS is that the computer onboard the robot as well as a separate wifi connected computer, e.g. a laptop, which they refer to as \[Remote PC\], both are running ROS. However you can get a lot done with just the \[Remote PC\], to test and experiment with ROS.

So if you don't natively run on Ubuntu 16.04 you are going to want to install it on your computer. **Do not try to install it directly on your mac or windows computer.** If you're curious, you can see  <%= link_to_topic :problems_ros_mac %>

So instead you are going to have to create a virtual environment of some kind. Here are two approaches, both have been tested and seem to work well. Use the one that appeals to you.

#### 1 - Use VMWare

Brandeis offers us VMWare for free. VMWare is a Virtual Machine software that allows you to run any operating system natively. I had good success with it. I created a VM with Ubuntu 16.04 and then followed the standard process.

##### Tips
* Place the VM file (which will be around 20Gig so you have to have that much space) on a SSD (solid state disk) and allocate additional memory for it. I found performance to be acceptable.

#### 2 - Create a Linux Partition
By using this approach, you will get a real desktop uBuntu system on your Mac.

Time approx. needed: 3-4 hrs. 

What you need  
* A Mac with free disk space of 15GB or up

* A USB flash Drive of 2GB or up

* (recommend) USB keyboard and mouse instead of wireless

* (recommend) Mac with 2 GB of RAM and a 2 GHz dual-core processor or up. Though my 1.3 GHz still functions properly.


After checking that you satify all requirements above to get a desktop version of linux on Mac, follow step-by-step the article [How to install and dual boot linux and Mac OS](https://www.lifewire.com/dual-boot-linux-and-mac-os-4125733). All details and potential problems you may encounter during installation/booting have been fully discussed in the article.  

Here is a brief skeleton of the steps from the article: 

1. install [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.github.io)

1. download a bootable uBuntu system from UNetbootin onto your USB flash drive

1. configure an independent partition for uBuntu on Mac

1. (optional) install dual-boot manager [rEFInd](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/)

1. restart you Mac and boot into the live uBuntu from USB drive 

1. after getting in, install the real desktop uBuntu on Mac
