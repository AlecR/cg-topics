desc: What are ROS actions and how do they relate to topics and services?

#### Review
* Nodes: all code written for ROS is a Node
  * A node is like a process
  * You run it with, e.g. `$ rosrun`
* Topics: the fundamental way nodes communicate with each other
  * Topic naames
  * Publishers and Subscribers
  * Message with data types
* Services: Synchronous communication
  * Client/Server
  * Ask and answer
  * Like a function call

#### Actions
* For long running activities, for example, navigate to somewhere
  * Activity is initiated
  * From time to time it reports its progress
  * Activity announces that it has terminated (successfully or not.)

#### Creating an Action
* Analogous to topics and services
* File now has three sections
