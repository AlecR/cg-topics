### Homework Mechanics

<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>

#### Facts
* Every lecture has a lecture number
* Every assignment has a code, X.Y, where X is the lecture number and Y is the assignment within that lecture
* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable"
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get the same mark for it.

#### Your responsibility
* You are responsible for reading the *lecture's page* before each class.
* All homework is handed in in Latte.
* All written reports, reflections, responses should be submitted as **PDF** and must include your name, team name if appropriate, and course number in the text of the submission.
* Code and other non-text submissions can be submitted as-is or as a .zip file
* Unless otherwise specfified, homework is due on class day at class start time.

#### Automatic deductions
* If you hand  in up to 3 days late we will automatically deduct 20 points.
* If you don't hand in homework by the due date and time, it is marked as a zero.
* If you don't hand in homework in the right form (e.g. "pdf, with your name and course number in the text")
* No exceptions unless pre-agreed in an email by either the Professor or a TA.

#### Numbering scheme in detail:

* Homeworks that have an expected deliverable:
	* Will be clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
	* Can be identified by a code, X.Y: X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture
	* Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
* To help you navigate, there are the following symbols:
  * <%= pdfbadge %>: this symbol reminds you that you are to submit a pdf to latte. Anything else will receive a 0.
  * <%= partbadge %>: this symbol tells you that this assignment is graded as "participation only". You will receive a 100 if you show a good faith effort, without regard to whether your answer is correct. You will receive a zero otherwise
  * <%= timebadge %>: This symbol reminds you that this assignment is due in the morning on the day of class. No late submissions or make ups are accepted.
  * <%= codebadge %>: \[**Not applicable to Cosi165**\] This symbol reminds you that this is a coding assignment which you will do inside your **portfolio**
