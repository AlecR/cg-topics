##### Required

* [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) This is the book by Eric Ries that first promoted the term "Lean Startup", and while there are multiple books and methodologies, my experience is that this is an excellent and quick summary of a highly effective way to approach Software Entrepreneurship.

##### Also of interest

* [Running Lean](https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172). Iterate from Plan A to a Plan that Works. A spinoff book from Ash Maurya which takes the Lean Startup further and in more detail.

* [Scaling Lean](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Mastering-Metrics-Startup/dp/1101980524/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51fIsKdyuDL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL320_SR316%2C320_&psc=1&refRID=2Y9GMRA245QAX01RKRC9). Also by Ash Maurya, looks at a longer horizon. Focuses on Mastering the Key Metrics for Startup Growth.
