title: Agile applied to Lean Startup
---

#### Kanban

We will use Kanban approach Lean Startup using ideas borrowed and adapted from Agile. I am developing a <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %> to help guide teams through the term project.

##### Trello
* Preferred tool for tracking stories
* Get one account for each team
* Share it with Professor and TAs
* Start with these "lanes"
  * Backlog
  * This Week
  * Next Week

##### Story
* A brief (1-3 sentence) summary of something that has to be done
* Level of detail corresponds to what would be needed to complete the story.
* All stories start off in the backlog
* Every "idea" or piece of work should be a story on trello

##### Iteration
* Use a weekly iteration corresponding to the class schedule
* Every Tuesday is another iteration
* At the start of the iteration, reprioritize
* Some number of stories from the top of the backlog are planned for the coming week.
* Associate specific students which storeis to be done this week
* Whenever new ideas come up, during brainstorming or anything else, add them to the backlog.

##### Kanban Leader
* I suggest (but don't require) that you choose one student to be the Kanban leader
* In charge of the discussion at the start of the iteration
* Follows up to see that things are going as planned
