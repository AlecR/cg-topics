**The Agile Manifesto**

<div class="well">
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<ul><li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
</li><li>Working software over comprehensive documentation
</li><li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
</li><li>Responding to change over following a plan
</li></ul>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
