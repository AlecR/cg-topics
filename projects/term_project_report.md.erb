title: Term Project Final deliverables

#### Contents

Each final report is different because each product is different. In some cases the vision is very simple to explain, but the business model is complicated and takes several paragraphs. In other situations, the only way to explain things is with a diagram or with reference to outside research. Sometimes a working prototype is the most compelling.

Below is  general guide to the kinds of information that might appear in your report. It is deliberate that there is not a specific required outline. We want you to discuss and debate with your team what makes the most sense for your project and then divide up the work among your team members.

<%= callout("Important", " These are more topics than you can possibly cover in the presentation. It's expected that some be relegated to the report.") %>

* Product name, team members names and emails
* Product description consisting of: (1) a one or two line summary. This summary should be descriptive and illuminating not a slogan or catchphrase. (2) An overall vision for the product, the impact it can have broadly speaking. (3) A descriptive explanation of what the product actually is and does. (4) Supplemented by scenarios and/or use cases, which are kind of stories, perhaps with several scenes, of the product or service in action. Note: Be careful and test whether someone reading this fresh will actually *understand*.
* *Hypotheses:* What type of hypotheses did you consider and test? (customer, problem, etc.) Which were leap of faith? Which ones did you validate and which ones failed? By what evidence? Also, list the experiments, the design and results of "out of the building 'experiments'"" to test hypotheses with multiple proven or disproven. What tools and techniques did you use, what were the results? Which ones would you still like to validate? What dead ends did you pursue?
* *Competition*: Name several products or services that you view as your closest competitors. What might be your response to them? Why are you worried or not worried about them?
* *Mockup/Prototype*: A visual mockup or good paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design. It should include all the important screens and give the reader a real sense of the product.
* *Conclusion and Strategy*: Strategy going forward: Immediate next steps; identified risks and ways of addressing them; reasons to believe this will be a fundable product going although further pivots will be needed


##### Optional ideas:
* *Other Visuals*: Any web site, diagram, sketch, photograph, diagram or flow chart that would illustrate the product and the research
* *MVPs*: Sometimes it is useful to supplement the report with the series of MVPs that you developed to get to this point.
* *Product Flow*: A diagram showing the flow of screen to screen in the user interface and explanation thereof.

#### How to write an excellent report

Based on my experience in previous years, here are some general tips that will allow your report to stand out.

* Give consideration to visual appearance of the report, it should look professional.
* It should have a logical flow of an argument with an introduction and a conclusion. It should be readable as a stand alone document without reference to your presentation or previous homeworks in class.
* Try to have as much substance as you can based on outside research, meetings, references etc. Don't be satisfied with just a few datapoints. Show that you've 'done your homework'
* Your work is evaluated not just on whether you follow the steps or the format but based on whether you are beinmg realistic and intellectually honest about your proposal. Would you actually pitch this to an Angel?

#### Report Specifications
* Report should be submitted as a pdf
* Length should be between 5 and 15 pages, including a title page
