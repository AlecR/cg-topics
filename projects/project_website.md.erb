title: Project Web Site
---
#### What is it
For every project, part of the final deliverables is a project web site. This is a single page web site, including text and graphics, that explains the story of the project. It should include the team, background, the vision, mockups, prototypes or working product, story of false starts and discoveries, pointers to git repositories, and anything else that tells the story.

#### Where to create it
Create it on a server which will survive from semester to semester and even after graduation. Possibilities are:
  * a single page static web site on Github
  *
