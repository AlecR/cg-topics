title: Final Presentations

### Showcase Day Presentations

* The showcase will be held in a slightly larger classroom (not yet assigned)
* It will be on December 14, from 6:00 to 8:00pm
* The audience will be your classmates and anyone else you want to invite
* You should wear "business casual", no ties or dresses required.
* Whatever you feel comfortable with.
* There will be a panel of "Product Reviewers" to listen and comment on the presentations
* I will determine the order at the last minute
* The PRs will give their feedback and rank the products
* But, your grade will be based on much more than that.

#### What PRs will be looking for
My instructions to them will be something like this:

* Students have been studying Lean Startup for 3 months
* They have worked in teams of about 4 on a product of their own devising
* They are given 8 minutes to present pitch their business
* It is likely that they have pivoted at least once during the semester
* They have written a far more detailed report (but that you won't be looking at)
* Please look for the following:
  * Can you really understand what they are proposing?
  * Have they done a credible job backing up their story with 'outside' data?
  * Are they persuasive in their presentation?
  * Consider the proposed pricing, growth assumptions, and market segments
  * Would you give this team seed money to develop the ideas further?

#### Slides and/or demo
* Given the time you should probably not have more than 10 slides
* Think of the slides as a story. Make sure there's a logical flow to them.
* Make sure there's a clear beginning slide and a clear final slide.
* As each product is quite different, there's no single recommended outline
* Don't have too many words on the slides. Don't read the slides.
* Visual images - diagrams, screenshots etc. are great
* Weave in your empirical (out of the building) quant or qual info whereever possible
* Below are a set of possible topics to give you inspiration. Pick and chose.

#### Topic Ideas for Presentation Slides and Final Report

* Problem, or Opportunity, or How the world today sucks. A strong problem statement. What can be improved? What is the pain you are alleviating or pleasure you can deliver? Make sure it's credible and serious enough that someone would actually pay for it.
* Value Proposition in more detail. For specific segments what are the pain points? What is the value to the customer of alleviating that pain or providing that pleasure?
* Product, Service or other description. Very important that the listener understand what you are proposing. Many teams miss this. If the listener is vague or confused about what it is, they will be distracted for the rest of the presentation.
* How does it work, what is the underlying magic, are there any interesting technology elements, what is non-obvious? The less text and the more diagrams, schematics or flowcharts, the better. If you have a prototype or demo to show that would be excellent as well.
* Who are your target customers or users and how might you reach them? Where do they congregate? What evidence do you have that they want and will use and will have benefit from what you are proposing?
* What is the business model, what kind of pricing have you tested, are there any analogies with existing products or services you can use to justify, have you created a simple financial model to forecast growth?
* What similar products exist that would be competitors to your product? Can you analyze competitors using a feature grid? Does their existance support or refute your product ideas, how are you different or differentiated from them?
* How confident are you in this product, how excited are you, what is needed next, what is the team's recommendation, is there a pivot that you know you need, are you ready for seed funding, are you planning to apply for Spark?
