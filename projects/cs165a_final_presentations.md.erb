title: Final Presentations

#### Showcase Day Presentations

* The showcase will be held in a slightly larger classroom (not yet assigned)
* The audience will be your classmates and anyone else you want to invite
* You should wear "business casual", no ties or dresses required.
* Whatever you feel comfortable with.
* There will be a panel of Judges to listen and comment on the presentations
* I will determine the order at the last minute
* The Judges will give their feedback and rank the products
* But, your grade will be based on much more than that.

##### Slides and/or demo
* Given the time you should probably not have more than 10 slides
* Think of the slides as a story. Make sure there's a logical flow to them.
* Make sure there's a clear beginning slide and a clear final slide.
* As each product is quite different, there's no single recommended outline
* Don't have too many words on the slides. Don't read the slides.
* Visual images - diagrams, screenshots etc. are great
* Weave in your empirical (out of the building) quant or qual info whereever possible
* Below are a set of possible topics to give you inspiration. Pick and chose.
