title: Final Deliverables
---

#### Summary

This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome!

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The important things are the journey, the process, and what you learned that will help you be a better entrepreneur.

#### Specific Deliverables
<%= callout("Due Date", " The final deliverables are all to be submitted to Latte by no later than December 9 at midnight") %>

1. An 8 minute presentation. Will be delivered by all the students on a team. The presentation needs to be rehearsed and fit to the time constraint. Questions will be held to the end, and will go for up to 8 minutes. You can think of the audience as angel investors. You should prepare
slides for the presentation using Google Docs. These should be submitted for grading as a pdf.

1. Paper (Report) Of your project, with additional information (5-10 pages.) You can assume that whoever reads it also has the presentation slides. You can think of the audience for this piece to also be angel investors. You should submit it for grading as a pdf. See <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report %>

1. A Project Report static web site, consisely reporting on the project, the process and the results. Here are some suggestions for the <%= link_to_topic :project_website %>. Each team member can use this as a part of their future portfolio

1. I will add each product to which we will add to a [Cosi Projects](http://bit.ly/cosiprojects) web site and you can use for letting other people learn about your project. One last deliverable is a text file formatted as follows that will be used for that purpose. The text in parentheses is where you should put your info. It all already appears in your other documents.
