title: Term Project Final Deliverables
---

#### Summary

This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome!

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The important things are the journey, the process, and what you learned that will help you be a better entrepreneur.

#### Final Presentation Day ("Friendly Shark Tank")

On Wednesday, December 13, 2017 6:00 p.m. â€“ 9:00 p.m. we will have final presentations. Several industry and/or venture experts will be invited to listen to each team do their presentations, ask questions, and have one on one conversations while we munch on snacks and drink delicious beverages.

The Judges will ask to review the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. Their review will be based on the formal presentation. But your grade will be based on that plus the the additional deliverables described below.

##### What Judges will be looking for

<%= callout("NB", " It is crucial that the reader/listerner clearly understand what your product is trying to do and for who. More than once I've seen the audience puzzled about the basic question: what is this product and what does it do? Don't let that happen to you! Test it with friends and family!") %>

* A strong problem statement. What can be improved in the way things work today?
* A clear explanation of what the product or business idea is
* An explanation of how this product or business fixes the stated problem and "why now?"
* Empirical information ("getting out of the building") supporting the project -- talking to people, surveys, looking at other products or web  sites, data from studies that might be relevant
* A discussion of the business and growth model. How do you plan to make money, how you will drive growth, how much funding you think you will need, etc.

**Not an outline!** Note that the above is not an outline. You can structure your presentation along the lines that Bill Wittenberg suggested, or you could structure it along the lines of the <%= link_to_topic :business_model_canvas %>, or you can do something different.") %>

#### Specific Deliverables

1. An 8 minute presentation. Will be delivered by all the students on a team (although they don't all have to speak or speak the same number of minutes.) The presentation needs to be rehearsed and fit to the time constraint. Questions will be held to the end, and will go for up to 8 minutes. You can think of the audience as angel investors.

1. Slides for the presentation. These should be submitted for grading as a pdf.

1. Paper (Report) Of your project, with additional information (5-10 pages.) You can assume that whoever reads it also has the presentation slides. You can think of the audience for this piece to also be angel investors. You should submit it for grading as a pdf. See <%= link_to_topic :term_project_report %>

1. A Project Report / Portfolio static web site, consisely reporting on the project, the process and the results. Here are some suggestions for the <%= link_to_topic :project_website %>. This is part of your portfolio which we will add to a [Cosi Projects](http://bit.ly/cosiprojects) web site and you can use for letting other people learn about your project.

1. A text file describing the project, following these instructions: <%= link_to_topic :brandeisprojects_md %>. This will create the entry for your project in [BrandeisProjects](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/)
