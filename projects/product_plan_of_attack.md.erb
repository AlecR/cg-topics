#### Deciding what your MVP will be
* Make a list of stories, very small steps
* With your team, try to keep them in priority order
* Design the MVP :
	* MVP: the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. 
	* What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that?
	* Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. * Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. 
	* That's the MVP

##### Narrow your focus!
* Make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views
* Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work.
* Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
* Divide and conquer! Make sure each team member has a distinct deliverable!
* Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!
