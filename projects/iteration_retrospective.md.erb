title: Iteration Retrospective
---
#### Definition

For our purposes an Iteration Retrospective is a short writeup in three sections.

* What did our team complete this iteration
* What do we hope to complete next iteration
* Issues and blockers

As an aside, these questions are known as "the three questions" and are inspired by and mentioned in a lot of the Agile literature. For example see: [Daily Scrum Meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum)

#### Submitting your Retrospective
* Retrospectives should be submitted once a week.
* Send it as an email to your TA Partner
* Submit it to latte
